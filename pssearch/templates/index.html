	<p>This is a simple website for me to get some programming expierence. It is not intended to replace Fisu or Dasanfall for character searching. Thus the character search is rather weak. The main focus is to create live character session tracking through the browser alongside outfit tracking. The elo system is probably too complex for me to implement.</p>
